            <p>
                Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my work within the my PhD studentship.
                It has been a process where my perception of the self has vastly changed, and
                where I have got to truly know my limits in the work as a researcher. Now that
                I am in the last months, and that I have to tie up all loose ends, I look back
                and see many of the mistakes I've done and the misconception I have believed in 
                for far too long.
            </p>

            <p>
                The research work has nothing to do with a conventional job. Not that I've ever
                done anything remotely close to a conventional job. Research work is ascribed 
                to knowledge work. If I understand correctly, this is work where you mostly use
                your brain, you rarely get up from your desk, and you are in a constant state 
                process of information gathering and decision making. Knowledge job can be very 
                frustrating if seen through the lense of common concepts like productivity or 
                return on investment.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason is rather simple, yet it was very hard for me to grasp. In a knowledge job,
                as in research, what is valued is not how hard you work, but the quality of 
                your thinking. This reads at first like a eye-rolling-inducing sentence that angers
                everyone in the room. But the truth is that success in a PhD or research endeavor
                is synonym with clarity or rather, I think, three stages of clarity. These three
                stages are:
            </p>

            <ol>
                    <li>Clarity on the "problem" i.e., its nature and definition;</li>
                    <li>Clarity on the body of existing knowledge that surrounds it (the "overview"
                        that has to show up in every paper");</li>
                    <li>Clarity on the steps required to solve that specific problem.</li>
            </ol>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                A normal job requires the production of <b>something</b> and hard, prolongued work
                can increase the amount of <b>something</b> that is obtained at the end of a day. 
                A knowledge job requires clarity. There are <b>something(s)</b> that are generally
                mistaken for productivity markers in a knowledge job. For a researcher, for example,
                the number of papers written in a year, or the number of citations on each publication,
                are an index of "worth". 
            </p>

            <p>
                These are indeed markers of how good you are as a researcher. The problem i.e., what
                took me an embarassing time to realize, is that these are also really the collateral
                effect of having obtained the three clarities I discussed above. When someone
                has reasoned long enough on a problem, why it exists, what is done to deal with 
                it, and what could be done to tackle it better, the executive part of the research job
                (experimental work, writing papers, discussing results with peers) becomes a natural 
                extension of the reasoning that preceded it.
            </p>

            <p>
                This feels oh so obvious and, honestly, too late for what is my situation at the
                moment. I whish I had understood this sooner. The experience I know have tells me 
                that any work must be backloaded with heaps and heaps of thinking. This stupidly feels
                like wasted time when deadlines are closing in. But that's just my inexperience. If
                I want to produce anything with a smidge of quality in it, I have to have thought 
                about it for long, and have produced good grade clarity to sustain it. Otherwise there
                is no point.
