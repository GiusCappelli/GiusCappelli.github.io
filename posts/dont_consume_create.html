                The realization that the habit of consuming online content takes time that would be
                naturally spent creating, had we given it the chance.

                I have been struggling with the idea of productivity for quite some time, since the
                start of the PhD studentship actually. In my quest to push back against
                procrastination, I felt the need to reduce my screen time. I am an avid YouTube 
                user, averaging 4-5 hours of daily YouTube app usage. Definitely too much.
                For about a year I have kept the screen of my phone in shades of gray i.e., 
                removing all color. The idea was to make it less appealing to look at, and 
                therefore less captivating. This worked for maybe one or two months. Eventually
                I became used to it, and the habit of opening the YT app every free (or busy) 
                moment came back. Moreover, having a greyscale screen makes you unable to see the 
                colors of the photo you take. As soon as I had a new phone, I ditched the greyscale
                screen. Back to ground zero.

                I changed phone in December last year, now we're in August. I cannot say why, but
                last week I felt my relationship with the YT app deteriorating. I just started to 
                pay attention to how much time I was spending on it. It suddenly became real, 
                tangible. I found myself questioning "Is this drugs?" while coping for some 
                work-related stress by scrolling YT shorts every other 15 minutes. 
                If that is not drugs, it surely looks like it from the outside. Since when have I 
                been spending all extra time, micro-pauses and procrastination periods by watching
                YT videos? For the past... ten years? Twelve?
            </p>

            <p>
                And then it hit me. What would happen if I just stopped? What would I do with all
                that time? How would it feel?
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently challenging myself. No YouTube. Straight up. I won't watch videos
                to spend idle time at least until the weekend. I will try moving past this weekend
                into next week without opening the YT app. I started today, and I can already tell
                that there is some visible difference in how I feel. Initially, the habit kicks in
                and my thumb just goes through the motion to launch the app. That is ingrained 
                muscle memory, and now that I'm writing it I feel this should not be a thing. 
                When I stop and remind myself that I just want to reappropriate myself of that time
                YT takes away from me (or rather, the time I systematically put into YT), I stop 
                and put the phone face down. I look straight in front of me, and let the craving
                wash away.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first question that comes to mind is "what now?". I feel lost for a minute.
                Then, naturally, so many alternative ways to spend time pop up as plausible,
                preferrable answers. If I'm at work, I realize I don't need that scrolly-scrolly
                pause, I actually have things to do. Thoughts about how to solve my problems
                don't have to wait for my micro- (or macro-) procrastination now to show up in my 
                head. If I cannot solve my problems now, I do not give myself the short-lived 
                dopamine hit by watching a video. I give myself the luxury of thinking more about
                that problem.

                Afterwork I am usually mentally depleted. No YouTube videos to pass the time
                before, during, after dinner. What now, then? Today I came back home and I worked
                out. I then had dinner looking at the view outside the window: it is a beautiful 
                summer day on the northern coast of Brittany, and it deserves contemplation. I kept
                reading "Networks" by Mark Newman after dinner, I'm almost through Chapter 5.
                Then I cloned the github page repository onto this old PC, and started blogging.

                I feel creative. And I feel that the message of this post is already well 
                delineated. It has been only one day, but I think I have learned something important
                firsthand: when I free time from consumption, that time is filled with creative
                or otherwise body- or mind-healing activities. In other words, time snatched from 
                consumption of useless on-line content tends to become time for self-expression. 
                For creation.

            <p>
                Why consume when you could create?
